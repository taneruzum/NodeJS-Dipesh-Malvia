# NodeJS-ExpressJS
Backend Trial

To get started, follow these steps:
1. Install the necessary Node.js modules by running `npm install`.
2. Create a `.env` file with the following content, replacing placeholders with your actual values:
   ``
   PORT=5001
   CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb+srv://your-username:your-password@cluster.mongodb.net/your-database
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your-secret
   ``
3. Keep your `.env` file secure, as it contains sensitive information.
4. Start your project with `npm run dev` and access it on the specified port.

*To test your queries, you can use ThunderClient.*
Remember to keep your sensitive information, especially the `.env` file, private and do not expose it in your public repository.
TIP: You can add .env to your .gitignore file.
